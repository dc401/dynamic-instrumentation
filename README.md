# dynamic-instrumentation

This repo is part of a tutorial series written on my Medium article called: [**Instrument and Patch Your Way to Binary Enlightenment**](https://medium.com/@dw.chow/instrument-and-patch-your-way-to-binary-enlightenment-6dfd04d094c5)

After reading this article, you should be able to:

-   Understand the common methodologies for binary analysis and their differences
-   How dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) works
-   Be able to examine static file properties
-   Use debuggers for “cracking” or patching a portable executable ([PE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2002/february/inside-windows-win32-portable-executable-file-format-in-detail))
-   Use DBI frameworks for modifying an application’s behavior using injected hooks

All sample PE files and scripts provided are licensed under GPL v2.0. I have also provided presentations for quick reference as you read through if you feel you want to dig deeper into this subject.
